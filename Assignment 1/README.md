<h2>How to Install Libraries</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Pip Install Numpy</li>
    <li>PIp install Pandas</li>
    <li>Pip Install Matplotlib</li>
</ul>

<h2>Explanation:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.
    </li>
    <li>NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed. NumPy is a Python package. It stands for 'Numerical Python'</li>
    <li>Pandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of another package named Numpy, which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays.</li>
    <li>matplotlib. pyplot is a collection of functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB. Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc. In matplotlib.</li>
</ul>
